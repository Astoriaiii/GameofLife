The game will be activated by inputing a file name.

The game could be initialized by two ways: 1.by inputing size and clicking squares 2.by reading state from file
There will be hint at first to let users play mode. If user choose A, the initialization will be the first one, but mode A is only for initialization and store the initialization results to files. After users initialize by mode A, there will be hint to remind user to get into mode B again for playing game. If user choose B, the initialization will be the read file one and users could play directly.

There are two mode for the playing mode: 1.users input number of steps 2.let the game evolves alone. If users input a negative integer, game will step into mode 2, which will be reminded in game. If users input a nonnagative integer, the conducting step will be the integer users input.
